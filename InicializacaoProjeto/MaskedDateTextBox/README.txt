The MaskedDateTextBox was created as a replacement for the Winforms MaskedTextBox. 

The .Net/Winforms MaskedTextBox was insufficient to the needs of a database project
I am working on for work. 

I feel that this implementation demonstrated improved date-masking and is more effective. 
However, in its current state, it is imperfect, and could use improvement. I'll post a list soon. 

In the meantime, feel free to fork. If you make some imrpovements, please submit a pull request. 
I will gladly accept your changes.
